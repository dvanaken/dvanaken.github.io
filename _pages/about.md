I am the co-founder and CTO of [OtterTune](https://ottertune.com), an AI-driven database optimization platform that automates tedious tuning tasks using machine learning. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was a member of the [CMU Database Group](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of database management systems and machine learning, specifically autonomous databases / ML for systems. Before my Ph.D., I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Washington.
